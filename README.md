# Desktop Notepad
A Desktop notepad app for Windows.

The attached zip file contains the notepad .exe file. It allows users to sign in with Google to create and save their notes to the backend server.

The app is cross-platform. The users' notes are also accessible on the React Notepad website, which can be found on this [website](https://notepad.kevindang12.com/signin), and on an Android Notepad app, which can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/KevinDang12/android-notepad-auth).

Here is a screenshot of the Desktop Notepad app login screen and notepad screen.
